  <h2>Taylor Auth</h2>

  <p>My name is Taylor Auth and I'm a first year student at the University of Pittsburgh. I'm planning to study Communication Sciences and Disorders and apply for the American Sign Language certificate. I grew up in Potomac, Maryland with my parents and 3 older brothers. In high school my favorite subject was ASL, which is why I decided to study to become a Speech Pathologist (SLP) and get the ASL certificate. This was reinforced even more when I shadowed an SLP at a local elementary school and fell in love with the job when I saw how I would be helping people everyday.</p>
  
  <p>Outside of school, some of my hobbies include watching movies, traveling, going to concerts, and hiking. Of these, hiking and traveling are probably my favorites, I already have plans to travel to Washington this summer to hike in Mt. Rainier National Park. The photos below show some of the most important things that have come to define me: my family and friends, pets, and experiences with nature.</p>
  
   <p>The main piece of my website is my Vine encomium, where I aim to explore and share why the app was such a hit and the impacts it still has today. Later on, I'll share why I chose to write about this app and the role it played in my own life.</p>

  <h2>Vine Encomium</h2>
  <h3>Six Seconds of Fame: A Vine Encomium</h3> 


<!--I got rid of the video here and think I'll add one below of some of the "iconic" vines that I grew up watching.-->
    <p>Vine, released in 2013 under Twitter‚Äôs ownership, immediately skyrocketed in popularity, captivating a global audience like no social media had done before. Vine wasn‚Äôt just any social media app, it took the world by storm because of its unique but simple form of content. For the first time, an app completely focused on short form looping videos, giving anyone the chance to go viral for anything, including comedy, music, acting, and more. However, this new, creative idea would soon be taken over by newer competitors like Snapchat and TikTok, and Vine's steady downfall would begin. 
In 2016, Twitter, who had acquired the app in 2012, announced that the platform would be shut down and removed from the app store in the coming months. This shocking news launched an outpour of tributes, not only from its popular creators, but also an entire generation who grew up on the app. While Vine's shutdown marked the end and start of a new era of social media, its influence on pop culture and the social media environment persists even 8 years later.</p>

	<p>With Vine‚Äôs innovative six-second format not only introducing a new way to consume content but also creating stars who remain household names today, its huge impact on pop culture can‚Äôt be denied (Tran, 2023). These creators included musicians like Shawn Mendes, comedians like King Bach, and video editors like Zach King, proving that any kind of content had potential to gain traction on the app. These viral videos transcended Vine, spreading across other platforms, reaching those who never even had the app, and becoming part of the broader internet culture (Rios, 2021). Iconic Vine quotes and clips such as, ‚Äúwhat are those?" or a potato flying around a room, will forever exist in the social media vocabulary and continue to be referenced.</p>

	<p>Despite Vine‚Äôs short-lived popularity and abrupt shutdown in 2017, the app has had a lasting impact on the current social media environment by paving the way for newer platforms. Vine was the first social media platform to include auto playing short-form videos, allowing for the rise of new types of content creators, audiences, and ways to go viral. Popular Vine creators were some of the first influencers that we now have a surplus of on other platforms like Instagram. As mentioned earlier, stars like Logan Paul and Shawn Mendes got their start after their 6 second videos blew up. Vine was the first example we had of a new genre of content creators, then called Viners, who could go viral and build a fanbase off only a few seconds of content (Dew, 2024). The app even became a helpful tool for the music industry, with both new artists, like Ruth B, and existing artists, like Drake, benefitting from the platform's community and new meme culture (Spanos, 2016). </p>

	<p>An article published on Vox shortly after the shutdown was announced states that the most common comment from non-users was ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt get Vine,‚Äù something that most people couldn‚Äôt fathom hearing now. Every social media focuses on short-form videos to some degree now, so imagining social media before this creation is a difficult task. The article also mentions that 6 seconds is the ideal amount of time for both the creator and the consumer, because ‚Äúyou can accomplish a lot in six seconds‚Äù (Romano, 2016). With a better way to make and interact with content, Vine became a space where people from every corner of the internet could come together and be part of the same community, ‚Äúproviding a perfect, innocuous interruption and respite from the routine of our daily lives,‚Äù (Wong, 2022). </p>

	<p>This idea would soon be followed up by Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, and most importantly, TikTok (formerly Musical.ly). TikTok launched in 2014 under the name Musical.ly, with a very similar concept to Vine, where creators could post 15 second videos with either music playing over or using an original sound. This new app gained traction slowly but blew up in 2017 -as Vine‚Äôs reign came to an end- after being acquired by ByteDance and merging with TikTok (Jalan, 2022). Many Vine creators made the switch to TikTok, lots of them switching even before the shutdown, and were able to continue making the same kind of content on a more versatile and opportune platform (Jalan, 2022). Without Vine, we wouldn‚Äôt have the apps and creators that we now love so much. </p>

	<p>In the four years that we had Vine, it had one of the biggest impacts on how we currently interact and consume media, some may argue even more than platforms like Facebook and Tumblr that are still around. Vine transformed social media by making short form videos the norm, a trend still prominent on other apps, inventing an easier way to create and to consume content, proving how even in a short amount of time, an extraordinary change can be made.</p>

<!--Add audience analysis on site or in comments-->
<!--Audience analysis: The target audience for my encomium consists of people who grew up using media platforms like YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, and of course, Vine. This group of people are mostly Gen Z and some younger millennials whose first real experience on social media was Vine. To this group, I aim to educate them on how Vine paved the way for these more successful platforms that now have such a hold on us as well as how they shaped the current climate of pop culture. Also, in today‚Äôs world, social media can have a very negative connotation at times, so I intend to turn back time for my audience, allowing them to reflect on a happier and more positive time.-->

  <h2>Why I chose Vine</h2>
  <p>I chose to use Vine for my encomium because of my personal experience with the app. I was only 7 when the app came out, but it was my first experience with social media. As the app blew up, I started seeing them on YouTube and hearing my older brothers talking about them. The main contributing factor however, was my older cousin. She was moderately popular on the app, launching her career as a comedian, and she featured me in a few of her Vines. I vividly remember visiting her family in Connecticut and helping her make a video in the backyard. This initial exposure to the app had me hooked, and while I was too young to have a phone at the time, I was able to download the app on my moms iPad. I still remember watching the first Vine that showed up when I downloaded the app, a couple singing the song "Santeria" by Sublime. This discovery launched me into the world of social media and not soon after I found Musical.ly (which would become TikTok). When I found out that the app was shutting down, I felt the way that most other watchers did, and always hoped it would come back. Writing my encomium about Vine was my way of brining it back into my life.</p>

<!--My first extra section is about why I chose Vine. I decided that I'd write one of my extra sections on this so that viewers of my website understand why I'd write an essay on this topic as it may be considred "outdated".-->

<div class="textblock">
  <h2>My Pets</h2>

<!--I miss my pets so I decided to make an extra section based on them. My older border collie, Lucie, is turning 10 in October which is unbelieveable. She's still super playful and spry for her age, she just tends to get grumpy now. I try not to think about her age though. I can't figure out how to make the images side by side and don't know if there is a way to without adding something to the CSS so i might just leave it as is or find another picture.-->

  <p>Featured above are my three pets; 2 Border Collies named Lucie (black) and Luna (gold) as well as a cat named Opal. Lucie and Luna have a love hate relationship; Luna is obsessed with Lucie, but Lucie is frequently annoyed with Luna. In the Summer their favorite activity is swimming in the pool, but in the Winter they love playing in the snow. Opal's favorite activity is sleeping, and when she isn't asleep, she's begging for food or watching the birds outside.</p>
