  <h2>Taylor Auth</h2>

  <p>My name is Taylor Auth and I'm a first year student at the University of Pittsburgh. I'm planning to study Communication Sciences and Disorders and apply for the American Sign Language certificate. I grew up in Potomac, Maryland with my parents and 3 older brothers. In high school my favorite subject was ASL, which is why I decided to study to become a Speech Pathologist (SLP) and get the ASL certificate. This was reinforced even more when I shadowed an SLP at a local elementary school and fell in love with the job when I saw how I would be helping people everyday.</p>
  
  <p>Outside of school, some of my hobbies include watching movies, traveling, going to concerts, and hiking. Of these, hiking and traveling are probably my favorites, I already have plans to travel to Washington this summer to hike in Mt. Rainier National Park. The photos below show some of the most important things that have come to define me: my family and friends, pets, and experiences with nature.</p>

  <h2>How Vine Highlights AI's Limitations in Video Creation</h2> 
<!--Currently stuck thinking of a title.-->

<!--I got rid of the video here and think I'll add one below of some of the "iconic" vines that I grew up watching.-->
    <p>Do you remember Vine? The app where people could post six-second looping videos of whatever they wanted? The TikTok before TikTok? <!---I still don't really like how I decided to start this essay off but I haven't changed it since I first started writing so I don't know how I could change it now. I usually really struggle to start essays and when I was writing supplemental essays when applying to colleges I started just writing the first thing that came to mind and going back later. Thats basically what I did here. --> Vine ruled the social media sphere from 2013 until its abrupt shutdown in 2017, sparking a new age of social media and content creation, one that consistently focused on or featured short-from videos. </p>

	<p>To myself and many of my peers, Vine was the app that set up how we would consume media forever, or at least the rest of our young lives. Whether it be through direct use of the app or watching compilations in the years that followed the app‚Äôs shutdown, the influence of Vine lived on in both the format and substance of content on other platforms. </p>

	<p>TikTok as well as Instagram reels followed in Vine‚Äôs footsteps, allowing anyone to create and post short form looping videos with no particular criteria. These apps started off just like Vine, with a consistent stream of unique content and fresh trends produced by the exclusively human users. </p>

	<p>When Vine ruled the internet, it seemed as if there was a constant flow of new and original content pouring onto the app. Vine creators and consumers were primarily, if not exclusively, human, so authentic creativity wasn‚Äôt difficult to come by. However, as AI has grown and video creation has developed, more and more short form content is being made by AI, producing repetitive and unoriginal videos that lack intention and emotional engagement. While it seems impossible to escape the plethora of dancing AI cats or unbelievable AI generated stories being told by robotic voices, it proves that video creation will always be ruled by humans.</p>

    <!--Many of the people I spoke to about my essay have had this same experience with AI cat videos and hearing AI voices telling crazy stories. I decided to include these specific examples as my intended audience is likely familiar with them. Since I (and those that I spoke with) are sick of seeing these videos, I hope for this to act as a sort of pathos, drawing out my readers individual feelings of them, which I suspect to be feelings of irritation.-->

	<p>Ted Chiang argues a similar point in his article ‚ÄúWhy A.I. Isn‚Äôt Going to Make Art‚Äù explaining how the lack of inherently human qualities makes AI incapable of creating authentic artwork. Chiang makes the point that artistic creation requires meticulously thought out and deliberate choices, something that AI is incapable of doing. Creators on Vine, called ‚ÄúViners‚Äù, only had six-seconds to deliver their content, making the decisions of comedic timing, visual aspects, and interactions with viewers crucial to each video. Although AI is able to generate videos based on preset algorithms and human input, it lacks the ability to make choices stemming from personal human experiences. </p>

    <!-- When writing my rhetorical analysis essay, I became really interested in the topic of AI art through the article. I thought it would be valuable to include the text not only for readers but also for myself. Chiang's article was what gave me the idea for my final essay and I felt like a piece would be missing if I didn't somehow tie this in. Since I view video creation as one of the most authentic forms of art, especially today, I knew I couldn't leave this out. When first adding it, I felt like it created a split in my argument, making the piece less organized and possibly less persuasive. However, I decided to try my hardest to smoothly incorporate it in and use it to strengthen my case as again, I would feel like something was missing without it. -->

    <p>A blog posted on <i>AIContentfy</i> corroborates this, explaining that AI‚Äôs limitations in generating video content consist of struggling to ‚Äú[create] realistic human emotions and behaviors,‚Äù and while AI can mimic patterns, ‚Äúit is not yet able to replicate the complexity and nuance of human emotion.‚Äù AI‚Äôs limitations set the stage for understanding the baseless threat it poses to video creation, but what really proves this is how humans have historically been able to push through given limitations and find ways to let their creativity shine.  </p>

<p>The lack of intentionality and thought behind AI video creation takes away from a key aspect of videos on social media‚Äì relatability. Videos made by artificial intelligence often feel hollow and are repetitive, while one of the main goals of videos made by humans is to be personal to the watcher. Social media has begun to feel less relatable and more boring since the rise of video creation by artificial intelligence.  </p>

<p>To truly comprehend why artificial intelligence will never overthrow humans in authentic video creation, we must consider the social media landscape that existed when creators were exclusively human. Vine was released under Twitter‚Äôs ownership in 2013, and abruptly shut down in 2017 after 4 short but impactful years. The app‚Äôs iconic six-second format introduced an all new way to consume and create media, allowing for virality like never before and creating stars who remain household names today. It was the first example of a new genre of content creators, then called Viners, who could go viral and build a fanbase off of only a few seconds of content (Dew, 2024). Vine‚Äôs human-driven content sparked creativity and virality, but the rise of AI-generated videos today highlights the limitations of artificial intelligence in creating authentic, emotionally engaging media. </p>

<p>In a way, Vine's six-second limit encouraged the app‚Äôs users to think outside of the box, finding new ways to share their talents and follow trends. In an article published on <i>The Atlantic</i> shortly after the news of Vine‚Äôs shutdown, author Robinson Meyer explains that ‚Äúthose six seconds could show anything,‚Äù followed by a few examples of vastly different things that went viral on Vine, and concluding with restating that ‚Äúthey were always six seconds.‚Äù Meyer goes on to claim that Vine‚Äôs constraints allowed the app to become a sort of experiment, allowing creators to embrace innovation and test the limits of what they could convey in such a short amount of time. </p>

<!--In this paragraph I reflected on my own experiences making vines with my older cousin. She was moderately popular on the app and all of her videos revolved around random comedy, like many other Viners. I remember being in my aunts backyard with her one year during Easter while she planned out the Vine she wanted to make. She told me exactly what to say and do. Although I barely remember what the final product was like, I do remember that it was hilarious, despite the time constraints. Looking back, I see how her creativity was tested by the apps limitations.-->

<p>And of course, as soon as this time was up, the loop sent viewers right back to the beginning, allowing them to watch everything unfold again even as they were still processing the first watch (Meyer, 2016). This pressure to engage viewers in such restricted conditions made Vine a place where spontaneity and talent flourished, where videos displaying true skills as well as ones that just aimed to be as random as possible could become equally viral. </p>

<!--Below, I originally wanted to include a few paragraphs about the difference in accessibility between AI and human video creation (shown through Vine). This was a major piece of my encomium and argument of how Vine has forever shifted the social media environment so I thought something would be missing if I left it out. However, as I continued writing I found that it seemed to break up the flow of the essay and I couldn't connect it the way that I wanted to. I decided to scrap that piece and instead find a better way to connect the prior paragraphs of AI's limitations to humans ability to push past the limits. -->

<p>Vine‚Äôs limits underline the biggest difference between AI and human video creation, which is that we are much more capable of overcoming our obstacles, and can do so on our own. In contrast, the development of artificial intelligence is confusing, as after their initial training, they quickly lose their ability to incorporate new knowledge (Wilkins, 2024). This uncertainty continually leads tech companies to just train new models, which is a costly and time consuming process. Researchers and teams have been trying to crack the solution to continual learning for artificial intelligence, spending billions of dollars and extreme amounts of energy on a skill that we as humans already possess (Wilkins, 2024). </p>


<p>This isn‚Äôt to say that AI can‚Äôt create meaningful videos, because it can. Everything created by artificial intelligence depends on the person on the other end. In his article, Ted Chiang includes the story of film director Bennett Miller and his rarely used method of AI art creation. Through the detailed prompts and numerous revisions that he subjected AI program DALL-E to, he was able to settle on twenty images out of the hundred thousand generated (Chiang, 2024). When AI is used carefully and more as an assistant in video creation, there is still intention and deliberation behind the final product. </p>

<p>AI can and will be used as a powerful tool in video creation, but the majority of the creation and planning shouldn‚Äôt be left up to it. With the assistance of artificial intelligence, our ideas can be brought to life exactly how we want them to be. However, when AI is expected to be the sole creator when making videos, the product will always feel shallow and artificial. </p>

<!--After removing the paragraphs about the difference in accessibility, I was lost on what else I could include to wrap up. I found myself looping back to my rhetorical analysis to see if I could expand on what I had mentioned earlier about Chiang's view of AI art. While reading through it, I was caught by what I had written about Bennett Miller and his use of AI in art creation. I found my own opinion slightly shifting as I realized that I probably see videos made with AI everyday and don't even realize because they're still primarily produced by a humans careful instructions.-->

<p>In conclusion, the growing presence of AI generated videos on social media may seem like a threat, but in reality it highlights the limitations of artificial intelligence, proving the strengths that only humans possess in video production. While AI may be able to mimic patterns and generate videos based on algorithms and the work of others, it lacks the intentionality and decision-making that come from the human experience, restricting the uniqueness and appeal of the products. The app Vine provides a perfect example of how the limitations given to humans foster creativity and innovation, highlighting how we are and will continue to rule video creation on social media. </p>

  <h2>Why I chose Vine</h2>
  <p>I chose to use Vine for my encomium and part of my final essay because of my personal experience with the app. I was only 7 when the app came out, but it was my first experience with social media. As the app blew up, I started seeing them on YouTube and hearing my older brothers talking about them. The main contributing factor however, was my older cousin. She was moderately popular on the app, launching her career as a comedian, and she featured me in a few of her Vines. I vividly remember visiting her family in Connecticut and helping her make a video in the backyard. This initial exposure to the app had me hooked, and while I was too young to have a phone at the time, I was able to download the app on my moms iPad. I still remember watching the first Vine that showed up when I downloaded the app, a couple singing the song "Santeria" by Sublime. This discovery launched me into the world of social media and not soon after I found Musical.ly (which would become TikTok). When I found out that the app was shutting down, I felt the way that most other watchers did, and always hoped it would come back. Using Vine for this course was my way of brining it back into my life.</p>

<!--My first extra section is about why I chose Vine. I decided that I'd write one of my extra sections on this so that viewers of my website understand why I'd write an essay on this topic as it may be considred "outdated".-->

<div class="textblock">
  <h2>My Pets</h2>

<!--I miss my pets so I decided to make an extra section based on them. My older border collie, Lucie, is turning 10 in October which is unbelieveable. She's still super playful and spry for her age, she just tends to get grumpy now. I try not to think about her age though. I can't figure out how to make the images side by side and don't know if there is a way to without adding something to the CSS so i might just leave it as is or find another picture.-->

  <p>Featured above are my three pets; 2 Border Collies named Lucie (black) and Luna (gold) as well as a cat named Opal. Lucie and Luna have a love hate relationship; Luna is obsessed with Lucie, but Lucie is frequently annoyed with Luna. In the Summer their favorite activity is swimming in the pool, but in the Winter they love playing in the snow. Opal's favorite activity is sleeping, and when she isn't asleep, she's begging for food or watching the birds outside.</p>
